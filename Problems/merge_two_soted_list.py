# Given two sorted list. We need to merge these two list such that the initial numbers (after complete sorting)
# are in the first list and the remaining numbers are in the second list. Extra space allowed in O(1).
#
# Example:
#
# Input: ar1 = [10]
#        ar2 = [2, 3]
# Output: ar1 = [2]
#         ar2 = [3, 10]
#
# Input: ar1 = [1, 5, 9, 10, 15, 20]
#        ar2 = [2, 3, 8, 13]
# Output: ar1 = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]
#         ar2 = [10, 13, 15, 20]
